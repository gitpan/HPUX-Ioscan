NOTE:  This is a version of Ioscan.pm that uses the OO methodology.  Its only
here until Dominique Dumont gets the permission to post a complete updated
HPUX::Ioscan.pm.  I've included this verision with only the OO portion of
the HPUX::Ioscan that I wrote.  Any installation of this module will overwrite
the old HPUX::Ioscan and remove the non-OO functionality.

Note that this module can work ONLY on HP-UX.

Suggested DSLI line :

HPUX
  Ioscan  bdpf  Perl function to handle HPUX ioscan commandk   CWHITE

The test will skip the actual ioscan command unles you are running on
a HP-UX system as superuser. I guess than you will have to trust me
with this module ... ;-)

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
