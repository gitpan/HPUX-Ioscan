This module works on top of the HP-UX command ioscan. It forks a
process to run the ioscan command and parses its STDOUT. The result is
returned in a hash.

Note that this module can work ONLY on HP-UX.

Suggested DSLI line :

HPUX
  Ioscan  bdpf  Perl function to handle HPUX ioscan commandk   DDUMONT

The test will skip the actual ioscan command unles you are running on
a HP-UX system as superuser. I guess than you will have to trust me
with this module ... ;-)

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
